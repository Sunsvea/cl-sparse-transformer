# Sparse Transformer Implementation

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Transformer model with sparse attention patterns. The goal is to explore and implement various sparse attention mechanisms to improve the efficiency of transformer models while maintaining performance.

## Current Features

- Local sparse attention mechanism (window-based)
- Configurable model architecture (layers, heads, dimensions)
- Basic positional encoding
- Simple training loop for sequence prediction
- CPU support

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sparse-transformer.git
cd sparse-transformer

# Install dependencies
pip install torch
```

## Quick Start

```python
# Run the example training script
python sparse_transformer.py
```

## Architecture

The current implementation includes:

- `LocalSparseAttention`: Implements window-based sparse attention where each token attends only to its neighbors
- `SparseTransformerBlock`: A single transformer block with sparse attention
- `SparseTransformer`: The full model with embedding layer and multiple transformer blocks
